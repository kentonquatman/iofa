      <p>No single agency can reach all vulnerable youth or address all of their diverse needs. Even large, effective agencies find themselves overburdened and lacking in both resources and capacity to address complex youth issues. IOFA works to coordinate efforts across child-servicing sectors and produce a multiplier effect that enhances the service capacity of organizations, both large and small, to address the complex needs of vulnerable youth.</p>

<p>We build local organizational capacity and organize coordinated community response mechanisms that leverage local resources, knowledge, and expertise. In this way, IOFA&rsquo;s project models offer long-term sustainability after IOFA leaves the program or project. We don&rsquo;t seek to supplant what is working on the ground or to build parallel systems; we seek to strengthen sustained, local response to complex child welfare issues.</p>
