	    <h2>UNICEF asks Congress to Strengthen Child Welfare Response to Child Trafficking</h2>
        <p>Recent reports have shown that the majority of child trafficking victims in the United States have had contact, often multiple times, with the child welfare system Separate studies in New York State, California, and Connecticut all found that most exploited and trafficked children had been involved with their child welfare systems. H.R. 1732 and S.1823 would require the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to develop and publish guidelines to assist child welfare agencies in serving survivors of trafficking, and youth at risk of becoming victims of human trafficking. It also helps improve data collection systems to better understand the scourge of human trafficking in our country.</p>
