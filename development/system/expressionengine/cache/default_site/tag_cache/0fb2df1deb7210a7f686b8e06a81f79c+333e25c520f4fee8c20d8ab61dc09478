          <p>Moizza Khan (pronounced MO-EEZA) comes to IOFA from the U.S. Department of State, where she&nbsp;spent over four years tackling international development and human rights issues at the Bureau of&nbsp;Democracy, Human Rights and Labor, the Office of the Inspector General, and the Middle East&nbsp;Partnership Initiative. A 2011 report that she led on the risk of trafficking in persons among U.S. embassy&nbsp;contractors received coverage in the Washington Post, the BBC, and other major news outlets, prompting&nbsp;immediate response from the Undersecretary for Management and a Congressional inquiry. More&nbsp;recently, Moizza served as a senior program analyst for international development programs reaching&nbsp;social activists, refugee women, and LGBT youth. Moizza started her career as a youth counselor for&nbsp;refugee and immigrant youth in the Uptown neighborhood of Chicago, which quickly led to opportunities as a&nbsp;grant writer and resource developer for a diverse range of social service and advocacy groups. &nbsp;As a&nbsp;consultant, she has also advised the philanthropic sector on major campaigns promoting foster care,&nbsp;juvenile justice, child welfare, and minority giving. Moizza received a Bachelor&#39;s degree in&nbsp;Communication, minoring in Asian Studies, from DePaul University and a Master&#39;s degree in Social&nbsp;Science from the University of Chicago, concentrating in Human Rights.</p>
